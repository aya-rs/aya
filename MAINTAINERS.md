# Maintainers

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for general contribution guidelines.
See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) for governance guidelines and maintainer
responsibilities.
See [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS) for a detailed list of owners for the various
source directories.

We use MAINTAINERS.md to track active maintainers and emeritus maintainers
rather than relying solely on GitHub teams. This codifies the process for
adding and removing maintainers as well, provides transparency, and leaves
an audit trail in the git history.
