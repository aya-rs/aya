## Overview

eBPF is a technology that allows running user-supplied programs inside the Linux
kernel. For more info see [What is eBPF](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf).

Aya is an eBPF library built with a focus on operability and developer
experience. It does not rely on [libbpf] nor [bcc] - it's built from the ground
up purely in Rust, using only the [libc] crate to execute syscalls. With BTF
support and when linked with musl, it offers a true [compile once, run
everywhere solution][co-re], where a single self-contained binary can be
deployed on many linux distributions and kernel versions.

Some of the major features provided include:

* Support for the **BPF Type Format** (BTF), which is transparently enabled when
  supported by the target kernel. This allows eBPF programs compiled against
  one kernel version to run on different kernel versions without the need to
  recompile.
* Support for function call relocation and global data maps, which
  allows eBPF programs to make **function calls** and use **global variables
  and initializers**.
* **Async support** with both [tokio] and [async-std].
* Easy to deploy and fast to build: aya doesn't require a kernel build or
  compiled headers, and not even a C toolchain; a release build completes in a matter
  of seconds.

### Example

Aya supports a large chunk of the eBPF API. The following example shows how to
use a `BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB` program with aya:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use aya::Ebpf;
use aya::programs::{CgroupSkb, CgroupSkbAttachType};

// load the BPF code
let mut ebpf = Ebpf::load_file("ebpf.o")?;

// get the `ingress_filter` program compiled into `ebpf.o`.
let ingress: &mut CgroupSkb = ebpf.program_mut("ingress_filter")?.try_into()?;

// load the program into the kernel
ingress.load()?;

// attach the program to the root cgroup. `ingress_filter` will be called for all
// incoming packets.
let cgroup = File::open("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified")?;
ingress.attach(cgroup, CgroupSkbAttachType::Ingress)?;
```
